The selection of food was not the best.,0
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!,2

I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!,0
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!,2
I really enjoyed Crema Caf矇 before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.,2
Not good for the money.,0

When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,2
Once your food arrives it's meh.,0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.,2
"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.",0

They were golden-crispy and delicious.,2
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.",0

Do not waste your money here!,0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,2
The cr礙pe was delicate and thin and moist.,2
Awful service.,0
Won't ever go here again.,0
Food quality has been horrible.,0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.,0

"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.",0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0

this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.",2
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.,2

I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
The service was extremely slow.,0

My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,2
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,2
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,0

If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,2
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,2
The pizza selections are good.,2
"I had strawberry tea, which was good.",2
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,0

Spend your money elsewhere.,0
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!,2
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,0
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!",0
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
We won't be returning.,0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,2
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,0
"Very, very sad.",0
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",0
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!",0

"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.",0
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.",0
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.",0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0
Disappointing experience.,0
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.",0
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0
We won't be going back.,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,0
This place lacked style!!,0
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.",0
Don't bother coming here.,0
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.",0
"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.",0
It was equally awful.,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,0
very slow at seating even with reservation.,0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0

I was VERY disappointed!!,0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.",0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,0
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.",0
Con: spotty service.,0
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.",0
But then they came back cold.,0
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.",0
The real disappointment was our waiter.,0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0
"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.",0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,0
But I don't like it.,0
Hell no will I go back,0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all"".",0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0
The ambiance isn't much better.,0
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.",0
The food wasn't good.,0
"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.",0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.,0

I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,0
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.",0
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.",0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0
Food was below average.,0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0
"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.",0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,0
"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.",0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0
Spend your money and time some place else.,0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,0
the presentation of the food was awful.,0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.,0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,0
Appetite instantly gone.,0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,0
"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.",0
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.",0
But the staff was so horrible to us.,0
"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.",2
"The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.",2
"Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great.",2
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).,2
"The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.",2
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.,2
"They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.",0
"It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!",1
The design and atmosphere is just as good.,2
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.,2
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.,2
"All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.",2
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.,0
"I asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.",1
"Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.",2

this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.,2
Two words: Free wine.,2
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.,2
"The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.",2
"I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.",1
The fried rice is amazing here.,2
"Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.",2
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.,2
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.,2
At the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup.,2
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.,2
The wine list is excellent.,2
"Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).",2
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.,1

I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds.,1
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.,2
"With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .",2
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.,0
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.,0
Not too crazy about their sake martini.,0
"Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.",2
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.,1

The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.,0
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.,2
"Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!",0
"Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.",2
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC.,2
"I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.",1
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).,2
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.,2
"An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.",2
"If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!",2

good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end.,2
"Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.",2

After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.,1
"The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.",0
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken.,1
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.,1
"However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot.",2
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.,2
"This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.",2
"my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the bagles are unbeliavably good.",2
"I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too.",0
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.,0
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.,2
"Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.",1
"The decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices.",2
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.,2
The setting is casual and romantic.,2
"Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.",0
"Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.",2
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.,2
"The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...",2
"I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.",2
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.,2
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.,2
"Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.",2
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.,1
"Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!",2
"A cheap eat for NYC, but not for dosa.",0
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.,0
"The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.",2
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.,1
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).,2
"($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).",0
"Really though, where's the seasoning?",0
"The food was just OK, at least for what food was available.",1
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!,2
"The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.",2
"Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.",2
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.,2
"We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.",1
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.,1
"otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.",2
"The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.",0
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence!,2
"I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....",2
"Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.",2
He offers subpar service and has no personality.,0
"The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.",2
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer....,0
"While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.",2
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.,2
"delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.",2
All the food was hot tasty.,2
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.,2
Our server was very helpful and friendly.,2
Try green curry with vegetables.,2
"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.",0
"The second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.",1
Much more reasonably priced too!,2
"The food was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.",0
Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?,0
"The Pad Thai is excellent here, as well.",2
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.,0
"We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.",2
"The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.",1
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.,2
I think the stuff was better than Disney.,2
"While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.",0
"Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.",2
"Well, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold.",0
The staff is no nonsense.,2
And really large portions.,2
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff.,2
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.,0
"We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.",1
"I recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.",2
"As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.",1
"The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.",2
"In fact, two people could really share one plate.",2
The food is great and authentic.,2
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.,2
"Anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.",2
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.,0
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.,2
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.,0
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.,0
But the coconut rice was good.,2
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.,1
The food was great.,2
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.,1
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.,0
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.,2
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.,2
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.,2
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.,2
"Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.",2
"The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.",0
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).,2
"But, they were too big for the bun.",1
"The food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.",2
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.,2
"A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.",0
The bagels are fabulous.,2
"Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.",1
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.,2
"The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.",2
The food options rule.,2
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.,2
"We ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.",1
"Probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).",1
"Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.",0
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.,1
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.,2
"Saturday, Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us.",2

"Authentic food and they have REAL service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.",2
Stick to the gulab jamun.,2
"I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list.",2
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.,1
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.,2
"We've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner.",1
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.,2
The food is great and reasonably priced.,2
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!,2
"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.",2
"The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese.",2
"My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.",2

Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.,2
"The food is terrible and overall, I would have to say avoid at all costs.",0
"Unfortunately, the food was NOT something to get worked up about.",0
"It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).",2
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.,1
"I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.",2
"The waitstaff were attentive, polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters.",2
"- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.",2
"The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.",2
"Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners.",2

We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit.,0

"We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.",2
"My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.",2
We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.,1
The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.,2
"Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!",2
The prices were fantastic.,2
"Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...",2
"The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.",1
"It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.",1
"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).",2
"i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.",2
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.,0

Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.,1
"Service was prompt, friendly and great.",2
"I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.",2
The sushi was awful!,0
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.,2
"The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.",2
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.,0
"Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety!",0
"After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.",0
It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.,2
"Behind this counter, two men are squeezed in.",0
"Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.",2

The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.,1
"All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!",2
"Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.",0
Service is top notch.,2
The food now is inconsistent.,0
"You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.",2
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.,1
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice.,1
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.,2
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.,0
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.,0
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.,2
"The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.",2
Service was quick.,2
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!,0

they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.,2
"Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.",2
It won't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food.,0

"if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side).",2
"No refills on fountain drinks, though.",0
Wow over 100 beers to choose from.,2
Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.,2
"The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.",2
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.,0
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening.,2
Did I mention the wine?,1
"Plus, on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!",2
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.,0
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.,1
"However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.",1
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.,0
"Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.",2
"After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.",2
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food.,2

My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.,2

"Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!",2
"I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.",2
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food!,0

kalbi and nebbiolo do work together.,1
"Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).",2
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.,2
Located at the end of a magnificent block.,2
"Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.",2
They don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum.,1
"Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).",2
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.,1
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.,2
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.,0
"I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.",2
"The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!",0
"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.",2
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.,2
"I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.",2
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.,2
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.,2
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines.,0
Pizza here is consistently good.,2
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.,2
"After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.",0
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!,0
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.,0
My husband and I enjoy Sangria.,2
"But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.",2
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.,2

"Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!",2
"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.",2
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.,0
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.,0
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.,2
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.,0
Other apetizers and food,1
The noodle and rices dishes taste great.,2
The food's as good as ever.,2
"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.",2
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.,1
"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.",0
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.,2
The sauces used are also not that exciting.,0
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.,2
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.,0
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!,2
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.,2
"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",1
"I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.",2
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.,0
"If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!",1
"There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.",1
The prices are wonderfully low.,2
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.,1
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.,2

No free drink.,1
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.,2
"While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.",2
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.,1

They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?,2
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.,1
"Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.",2
I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.,1
"While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.",2
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.,2
"Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!",2
"Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.",2
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.,2
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.,2
"I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).",0
"It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service.",2
You should pass on the calamari.,0
"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.",0
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.,2
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.,2
The fries are yummy.,2
"Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.",2
Best Taiwanese food in NY!,2
This place is a great stop for great food.,2
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City.,2
"We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel.",1
And the prices were way to high for what you get.,0
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.,0
"Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.",0
"The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.",2
"I need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!",1

The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.,2
The soup is pretty good too.,2
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.,2
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.,2
"If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!",2
"not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .",1
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh.,1
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!,0
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.,2
"Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.",0

I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.,2

The food is amazing!!!!,2

"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.",2
"The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!",2
The atmosphere is great!!!,2
"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.",0
"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.",2

"However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT.",2
Priced at upper intermediate range.,0
"If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.",0
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.,2
"they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.",2
I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.,0
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.,2
They used shredded cheese on top!,1
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.,2

Food is great.,2
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!,2
This place is incredibly tiny.,0
"I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.",2
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.,1
"The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.",2
"But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.",2
I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.,0
"The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.",2
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.,2

Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time.,0
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.,0

Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.,2
The fried rice is really good too.,2
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.,2
Made my dining experience uncomfortable.,0

"Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.",1
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.,2
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh.,2
The ceiling is amazing!,2
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.,1
Not a small feat for good french food in the area.,2
"The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.",1
Food was average but tasty.,2
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.,2
"The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.",0
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.,2
"With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.",1
"The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.",0
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.,2
"my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).",2

"The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.",2
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever.,0
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.,0
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.,2

"The food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.",2
"Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.",0
"NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.",2
Try the sea bass.,2
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.,2
Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.,1
"During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.",2
"But they don't have a toaster, which is strange.",0
"So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.",2
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.,0
A must for all the Dosa lovers.,2
"The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.",2
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.,1
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.,0
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.,2
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.,2
"Try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!",2

"It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.",0
"Got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.",1

This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.,1
"Oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!",2
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap.,2
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.,0
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.,1
Decent wine selection too.,2
"It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.",0
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.,2
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).,2
"Disappointing food, lousy service.",0
"If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place.",2
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.,2
"Over price, and small portions .",0
"Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.",2
The food was well prepared and the service impecable.,2
"BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.",2
"Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.",2
"My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.",0
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.,0
"Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.",2
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.,2
"Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.",2
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.,1
While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.,2
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.,0
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.,2
i would recommend reservations on weekends though.,1
Great pizza for lunch place.,2
The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.,0
We were a group of 8 and well seved.,2
"The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.",2

I noted it was crossed off on the bill.,1
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna.,2
The food was absolutely amazing!!,2
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food.,0

Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.,2
The staff is also attentive and friendly.,2
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.,2
"That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.",0
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,0
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!,2
"It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.",0
The food was good too.,2
"Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.",0
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!,2
"Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.",2
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.,2
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.,2
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats.,2
The menu is nothing like the one on the website.,0
"Great food, great lay out and awesome service.",2
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.,0

The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.,2
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.,2
"And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.",1
"We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.",0
sometimes i get good food and ok service.,2
"It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.",1
"After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.",0
The food was spicy and delicious.,2
Went for a late weekday lunch.,1

Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.,1
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.,2
"It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).",0
"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.",0
"We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.",1
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived.,2
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.,2
"While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.",2
"The service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.",2
We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.,2
"The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.",2
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.,2
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.,1
"We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.",2
The location is perfect.,2
"Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.",2
The lunch special is an asbolute steal.,2
This food is asian-air fusion.,1
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.,2
"The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.",2
"While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.",2

Not worth the prices.,0
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic.,2

And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.,0
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!,2
"I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.",2

We did have to wait at the bar for approx.,1
"If you love seafood, you would love this place!",2
"Good, fast service.",2
They charge different prices all the time.,0
"I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.",0
"My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer menu at Artisanal last night.",2
"It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.",2
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.,0
"In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.",1
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat.,2
"To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.",2
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).,2
The service was ok.,1
"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.",1
"Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.",0
"The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!",2
"The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.",2
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.,0
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.,2
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.,2
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation.,1
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.,1
"The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.",2
"No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.",2
"Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!",2
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).,2
"but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.",0
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.,2
now if they could only get a toaster.,0
"When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers.",2
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!,0
"The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.",2
Fish is so very fresh.,2
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.,2
"Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more.",2
less wait time for me!,2
"The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.",0
"Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.",2
It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.,0
"I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.",2
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.,0
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.,2
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.,2
The food was authentic.,2
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.,2
"I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.",2
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.,0
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry.,0
"We had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm.",0
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.,2
There is no excuse for such lousy service!,0
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.,2
"So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good.",2
"Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.",1
Not enough wines by the glass either.,0
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.,2
I must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view.,0
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.,2
"Just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.",0
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.,2
"We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.",2
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.,2
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food.,0
The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.,0
We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue.,1
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations).,0
"night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.",2
Try the green curry!!!,2
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.,2
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.,2
"You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.",2
The food there are sastifying.,2
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!,2
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.,2
"Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).",0
The food was good.,2
"Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.",2
"at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.",0
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.,2
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection.,2
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix.,2
"We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.",2
The place was nice and calm.,2
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.,2
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.,1
"When we sat, we got great and fast service.",2
"Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.",2
Service is average.,1
But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).,2
"They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.",1
"The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.",2
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.,2
"The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.",0
"My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.",2
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin.,2
The buffet had a nice selection.,2
Waitstaff are very friendly.,2
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.,0
Will have to return to try the chocolate!,2
"The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.",0
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.,2
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel.,1
service was efficient courteous.,2
The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.,0
They are the best bagels I've had.,2
I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food.,1
"Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.",2
"$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.",1
"While the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge.",1
"Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.",2
"We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!",1
"However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.",2
"The menu is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food.",0
The wine list is extensive and impressive.,2
We had the most wonderful waitress.,2
"While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly, I have never experienced more incompetency.",2
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.,2
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.,2
The staff is courteous and friendly.,2
Decor is nice though service can be spotty.,2
"Aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks.",0
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .,2
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar.,2
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!,2
"Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.",0
The specials are usually quite good too.,2
They've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods.,2
Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.,2
Really cool stauff inside.,2
"While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.",2
The best burger I have had in the Village.,2
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu.,1
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space.,1
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.,1
"The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.",2
Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (Anywhere).,1
"Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.",0
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.,2
"The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).",2
"Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?",0
Service was very good and warm.,2
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.,1
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.,2
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.,2
The food is nothing like its menu description.,0
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.,2
It's just O.K. pizza.,1
"The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.",1
"The service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly.",0
"Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.",2
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city.,2

The food was absolutely horrible!,0

"Not the greatest sushi place, but excellent for a $19.95 all you can eat.",0
"Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.",1
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy!,2
We've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?,2
Drinks way over priced.,0
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.,0
What I didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.,0
Moderate prices.,1
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.,2
"Most importantly, food is excellent.",2
"Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.",2
"The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.",2
"However, service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had.",1
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.,2
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.,1

"Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.",0
"The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.",0
"This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.",0

The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.,0

The wine list is also really nice.,2

You have to increase the service a lot.,0
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.,0
"I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.",0

"After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!",1

A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.,2

"I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.",1
The food was exceptional.,2
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?,1
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.,0
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.,2

Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!,2
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.,0
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.,2
"And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).",2
"The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.",0
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.,2
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.,2
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.,2
"You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.",2
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.,2
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.,2
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.,2

"The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.",2
"I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!",0
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.,0
"Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.",2
big and soft as well as good lunch food.,2
"No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.",1
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.,2
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.,2
"As for the bar, this is another bad idea.",0
"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.",1
"Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.",2
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.,2
"Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.",1

The highly spiced chai tea was great too.,2

"But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.",2
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.,2
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.,2
"You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.",0
"The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.",0
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.,2

The service is descent even when this small place is packed.,2
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.,2
I have eaten a lot of pizza here.,1

The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.,1
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.,2

This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.,2
The lox is always fresh too.,2
Service was very friendly.,2
